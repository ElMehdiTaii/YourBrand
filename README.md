# YourBrand

App for managing a consultancy business - from sales to running a project - A private business network.

This project brings [TimeReport](https://github.com/marinasundstrom/timereport) and a re-imagined [Showroom](https://github.com/marinasundstrom/showroom) together into one product. 

It also led to including other projects like FinanceApp and Catalog (Product Catalog). And then some additional services where created. That is how we end up with a basic ERP.

This is a concept developed when learning building distributed applications. It is not production ready. But please, be inspired! :)

Watch the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOtbuWFD650).

Based on the [item-catalog](https://github.com/marinasundstrom/item-catalog) project - which at the moment is more evolved. I try to keep the common functionality in sync.
